        <h2>What is Lechon Manok and where does it originate from?</h2>
        <p> <strong> Lechon manok </strong>  is a Filipino spit-roasted chicken dish made with chicken marinated in a mixture of garlic, bay leaf, onion, black pepper, soy sauce, and patis.</p>
        <p> The marinade may also be sweetened with muscovado or brown sugar. It is stuffed with <em> tanglad </em>and roasted over charcoal.</p>
        <h3>So what are the ingredients?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Whole chicken</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Lemon</li>
            <l>Onion</l>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Bay leaves(optional)</li>
            <li>Spices and Seasonings!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step by Step process in making our Lechon Manok</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the lemon, garlic, onion, and stuff it inside the chicken! (this creates beautiful flavor and juices inside the chicken.)</li>
            <li>Gently lift the chicken skin (do not rip the skin off) and put butter inside it.</li>
            <li>And lastly we are going to grill it for about 30 minutes on medium heat</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Then <em>voila!</em> our Lechon Manok is complete!!</h2>
